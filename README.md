###City-Routefinder-GraphAlgo
##Pathfinder around Waterford City vector map

This college assignment had the aim of using various graph searching and traversing algorithims to find different routes around a vector map.

This assignment scored 98% and was done in a team of 2.

* This uses depth first search to determine multiple path possibilities between two points.
* Breadth first search is used to calculate a single path, bfs has been modified to be BEST first search by sorting the agenda based on the distance between the nodes.

* This option uses Dijkstra's algoritm to determine the shortest route between two nodes based on their cost ie. Distance.
* There is also an option to use a historic route which will visit as much landmarks as possible.
* There are options to avoid and waypoint certain nodes on the graph.
